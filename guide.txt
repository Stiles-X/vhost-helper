Hi, this guide is a work in progress.
The program is split into App folder and Output folder so you 
know what you can touch and not touch.

What this program is - This program is to ease and automate the 
process of adding (not delete yet) hosts and vhosts (apache) entries.

In app folder, you can see 
main.py - the file you have to run.
Template.txt - the template used for new vhosts entries.
MainVarSet.txt - template variables but only for SvrName and Dir. 
    Don't add more variables here.
VarSet.txt - configuration for variables used in template.txt.
    Split from MainVarSet for customizability. add more variables here.
config.txt - Line 1 is for output folder. Line 2 for httpd-vhosts.conf path.
    Line 3 is for hosts path. and Line 4 is where in the hosts file you want to insert it *AFTER*.
        (not support line number, must be a phrase which is then matched using 'in' operator)
        Only the first one counts. Leave blank for end of file.
    Line 5 is like line 4 for vhosts.conf

Let me explain how template.txt works.
In template .txt, I have set default variables to be SvrName and Dir1 
(Dir conflicts with Directory).
In VarSet.txt, I identify them as SvrName and Dir1, line 1 and 2 respectively.
You can edit them as you wish. 
You can add more variables if you want in


// My guide sucks, please fix.
