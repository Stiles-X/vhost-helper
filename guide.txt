Hi, this guide is a work in progress.
The program is split into App folder and Output folder so you 
know what you can touch and not touch.

What this program is - This program is to ease and automate the 
process of adding (not delete yet) hosts and vhosts (apache) entries.

In app folder, you can see main.py - the file you have to run.
Template.txt - the template used for new vhosts entries.
VarSet.txt - configuration for variables used in template.txt

Let me explain how template.txt works.
In template .txt, I have set default variables to be SvrName and Dir1 
(Dir conflicts with Directory).
In VarSet.txt, I identify them as SvrName and Dir1, line 1 and 2 respectively.
You can edit them as you wish. You can add more variables if you want.
